# Double Auction under Uncertainty

## Why

Uncertainty and Variability

Duck curve in Califonia because of solar PV

## 1, DA with Stochastic Programming

linking constraints determine that the necessity of stochastic programming.

according to KKT, expectation of the real time price equals day-ahead price

can only ensure the cost recovery exptectically

## 2, DA with Robust Optim

inner problem is convex

find the worst case scenario engogenously

shrink the uncertainty set = introduce chance-constraints

## 3, DA with Distributionally Robust Optim

find the expected result from the worst distribution

ambiguity set

remove unrealistic distributions from ambiguity sets

unifortality
